# F1 Champions 

## Goal

Build and implement a production‑ready, end‑to‑end web/mobile application that:
- Shows Formula 1 World Champions from 2005 to the present year in an attractive
Single Page Application (SPA) or Mobile Application.
- Persists race‑winner data in a database and exposes it through your own backend
API.
- Ships with a fully automated CI/CD pipeline.
- Runs backend and DB locally with a single docker compose up command.
